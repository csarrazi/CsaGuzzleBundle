UPGRADE FROM 2.x to 3.0
-----------------------

The upgrade procedure is straightforward.

The 3.0 version bump was mostly due to the upgraded dependency versions and moving the middleware to separate repositories.

UPGRADE FROM 1.x to 2.0
-----------------------

### Known Backwards-Compatibility Breaks

* `ClientFactory` is removed.
* [Event subscribers](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/5.3/events.html#event-subscribers) have been replaced by [middleware](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/handlers-and-middleware.html#middleware).
* Support for `guzzlehttp/guzzle-services` and `guzzlehttp/guzzle-command` has been dropped.
* The bundle now needs at least version `6.0` of `guzzlehttp/guzzle`.
* Client and cache configuration have been simplified.
* PHP version requirement has been bumped to at least `5.5.0`.

UPGRADE FROM 1.2 to 1.3
-----------------------

### Known Backward-Compatibility Breaks

* `ClientFactory` was deprecated in favor of directly tagging Guzzle clients,
  and will be removed in 2.0.

Before:

```xml
<service
    id="acme.client"
    class="%acme.client.class%"
    factory-service="csa_guzzle.client_factory"
    factory-method="create">
<!-- An array of configuration values -->
</service>
```

After:

```xml
<service id="acme.client" class="%acme.client.class%">
    <tag name="csa_guzzle.client" />
</service>
```

UPGRADE FROM 1.1 to 1.2
-----------------------

### Known Backwards-Compatibility Breaks

* None yet.

UPGRADE FROM 1.0 to 1.1
-----------------------

### Known Backwards-Compatibility Breaks

* If you use the `Csa\Bundle\GuzzleBundle\Factory\Client`, the class was removed as it is no longer needed.

  You should now use the base `GuzzleHttp\Client` class, or your own class, extending Guzzle's class.

* If you registered event subscribers using the compiler pass, you now need to give it an alias.

Before:

```xml
<container>
    <services>
        <service id="acme_demo.subscriber.custom" class="Acme\DemoBundle\Guzzle\Subscriber\CustomSubscriber">
            <tag name="csa_guzzle.subscriber" />
        </service>
    </services>
</container>
```

After:


```xml
<container>
    <services>
        <service id="acme_demo.subscriber.custom" class="Acme\DemoBundle\Guzzle\Subscriber\CustomSubscriber">
            <tag name="csa_guzzle.subscriber" alias="acme_custom" />
        </service>
    </services>
</container>
```
